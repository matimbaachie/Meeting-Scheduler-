# Meeting Scheduler

## Project Summary  
I created a Meeting Scheduler app to facilitate booking, updating, and cancelling meetings. Azure AD authentication ensures secure access across all users.

The backend APIs were developed in ASP.NET Core, interacting with a SQL Server database through EF Core. The frontend is a React app integrated with Azure AD using MSAL.js.

## Key Features  
- Secure Azure AD login for users.  
- Create, update, cancel meetings with calendar views.  
- Role-based access controls.  
- React frontend with seamless Azure AD authentication.  
- ASP.NET Core backend APIs secured by Azure AD.  
- SQL Server database with EF Core migrations.  
- Full deployment on Azure App Services.

## Technologies Used  
- React + MSAL.js  
- ASP.NET Core Web API + Azure AD  
- Entity Framework Core + Azure SQL Server  
- Azure App Service  

## How I Delivered It  
- Set up Azure AD apps and configured authentication flows.  
- Developed API endpoints for meeting management.  
- Built React UI components for scheduling and calendar views.  
- Deployed frontend and backend to Azure with CI/CD integration.  
- Authored user manuals and technical documentation.

This project honed my skills in building scheduling apps secured by Azureâ€™s identity platform.
